## First impression

After the few first hours, I was very skeptical. Each time I gave Far Cry 6 a chance, I was leaving the game after 20 minutes. But, day after day, I was trying once more, and when it finally clicked, I couldn't wait to play the game again. The plot is very naive, most of the characters feel like they were generated by the AI, but the game has it's moments, gameplay feels smooth, the soundtrack is great and you can find a lot of decent looking spots that will make you want to enter into the photographer mode.

### Sountrack - 10/10

Definitely one of the strongest pros of the Far Cry 6. Right from the beginning the sountrack hits the right note and fits the game climate perfectly. I did not switch nor turned off a single song throughout the whole game, because I did not feel the need to that like I do in the racing games, where I pick 4-5 songs and listen to them over and over again.

- Great niche tracks mixed with classic & modern hits like 'Havana' by Camila Cabello or 'Livin' La Vida Loca' by Ricky Martin,
- A pretty decent original sountrack created just for the Maximas Matanzas, one of the in-game factions,
- Remixes of songs, such as Bella Ciao de Libertad, that fit perfectly into Yara's atmosphere,
- A lot of easter eggs related to car karaoke.

### Graphics - 7.5/10

While the game definitely has its moments and a lot of beautiful spots when it comes to the graphics, while playing on the Xbox Series X, most of the time you can feel that something is off, that the game engine behind the Far Cry 6, Dunia 2, has its best years behind. While the sun and lighting comes into play, the game makes you to turn into a photographer and turn the special mode to capture these great views, but most of the time I've felt like playing the game that was released 5+ years ago, especially compared to the games that I've completed recently like the Guardians of The Galaxy or The Dead Space 2023. Nevertheless, I think that Yara is definitely worth to explore.

### Plot & Characters - 5/10

This is the main reason that I could not dive deep into the revolutionist world since the first minutes - the game wants to be at the same time targeted to youngsters and adults. We are in the middle of the attack on a massive plantation guarded by dozens of snipers armed to the teeth. Amidst blood, tens of fired bullets, slaves, stress, and tension in the air, suddenly, from our companion, we receive a plastic crocodile-shaped helmet, in which we continue our takeover of the plantation. In subsequent missions, when we deal with half of the guards, our animal companion, for example, the disabled dog Chorizo, can take his half of the guards holding flamethrowers by himself. Imagine that you discuss attack plans in an abandoned mansion/hotel, when suddenly napalm falls from the sky, partially turning it into rubble. What does our companion El Tigre do? He starts doing push-ups, because there's always a good time for push-ups. And so on and so forth. Most dialogs feel like they were written by chatgpt. The plot is very naive, and the fact that some of the characters like the Anton Castillo or Camila Montero are way better written that the others, it cannot compensate the rest.

### Gameplay - 8/10

The gameplay is pretty smooth and offers mostly the very similar experience to the previous parts of the Far Cry. I would say that when it comes to FPS games, it is a pretty good system and the fighting part is better than in Starfield, but worse than in Dead Space. Enemies are not camping forever once marked and are also not a bag for bullets if aimed correctly or with proper weapons. Riding, both the road and the water, and flying is also satisfactory, and despite there are no bells and whistles, the game just feels like it does not need anything more in this aspect. It is cool that there a lot of options - car/tank/helicopter/motor boat/airplane/horse/wingsuit/paraglide, and many more, and all of these options are more than fine. Just the crafting part could be more satisfactory, because as of now one can feel that it has zero impact on the equipment, does not matter whether wielding level 1 or level 4 upgrades.
